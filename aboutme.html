									<h1>Gandhar Yedsikar<br />
									</h1>
									<p>I am a Computer Science engineer from the University of Toledo, Ohio. I currently work pro-bono as a Junior Data Analyst at Techpoint LLC, where I work with senior BA’s assisting them in writing Functional Specification Documents as well as performing operations like Data Extraction and cleaning using SQL queries and scripting languages such as R and Python. I also generate reports in MS Excel and construct active visualizations in the BI Tool tableau. In my spare time, I complete some personal projects and have enrolled myself in online certification programs to improve my knowledge and skills. One of those projects is the Student Management System with Database Connectivity which is a desktop application that is designed and built using Pycharm IDE. The application can be used efficiently for the management of the student data and can be exported as well. I am currently working on a case study of Google’s Data Analytics certification program wherein I handle 3 million rows of data and perform data cleaning and analysis which further assist the organization in making data driven decisions and novel marketing strategies to improve their sales.</p>

								<p>I am someone who strives to be a perfectionist and I have never-ending desire to learn something new every day. With respect to my personality, I am dedicated and very goal and service-oriented. I love exploring new things and never run away from challenges as I believe challenges allow for personal growth and help in looking at things in various perspectives. During my leisure time, I indulge in extracurriculars. I love to hike, travel and love playing soccer and cricket. I may come off as a shy, introverted character but I do love meeting and interacting with new people and growing my network.</p>
